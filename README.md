This is an example of me using <b>React, JSX, actions, reducers and components</b> to create a counter that steps up 1 each time the plus sign is pressed and steps down 1 when the minus
sign is pressed. There is an input field that takes in a number and changes the overall count for the counter. This example also shows the total times the plus or minus signs have been clicked and resets once a manual number has been input.
